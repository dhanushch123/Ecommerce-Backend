This class is a custom implementation of Spring Security's AuthenticationSuccessHandler that handles post-authentication logic for OAuth2 logins, specifically generating a JWT token and redirecting to the frontend.

Class Overview
java
public class CustomOAuth2SuccessHandler implements AuthenticationSuccessHandler
Implements Spring's AuthenticationSuccessHandler interface

Handles successful OAuth2 authentication scenarios

Key Components
1. Dependencies
java
@Autowired
JWTService jwtService;  // Service for JWT token operations

@Autowired
UserRepository repo;    // Repository for user database operations

@Value("${frontend.redirect.url}")
private String redirectUrl;  // Frontend URL from configuration
2. onAuthenticationSuccess() Method
The core method that executes after successful authentication:

java
@Override
public void onAuthenticationSuccess(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response,
        Authentication authentication) throws IOException, ServletException
3. Method Implementation
a. Extract Authenticated User
java
OAuth2User authUser = (OAuth2User) authentication.getPrincipal();

** CustOAuthUser service already sets OAuth user in authentication object after logged in through google **

String email = authUser.getAttribute("email");
Gets the authenticated OAuth2 user from the authentication object

Extracts the email attribute (common across most OAuth providers)

b. Retrieve User from Database
java
Users user = repo.findByEmail(email);
Looks up the user in the local database using the email

Assumes the user was already created during OAuth2 processing

c. Generate JWT Token
java
String token = jwtService.generateToken(user);
Uses a JWTService to create a JWT token for the authenticated user

Typically includes user claims/roles in the token

d. Build Redirect URL with Token
java
String redirectWithToken = UriComponentsBuilder.fromUriString(redirectUrl)
        .queryParam("token", token)
        .build().toUriString();
Constructs a redirect URL to the frontend

Appends the JWT token as a query parameter

Uses Spring's UriComponentsBuilder for safe URL construction

e. Perform Redirect
java
response.sendRedirect(redirectWithToken);
Sends an HTTP redirect to the frontend with the token

Flow of Operation
User successfully authenticates via OAuth2

Spring Security calls this handler

Handler extracts user information

Generates a JWT token for the user

Redirects to frontend with token in URL

Frontend can use this token for subsequent authenticated requests

Security Considerations
The token is exposed in the URL (consider using fragments or other methods)

Should ideally use HTTPS to protect the token in transit

Token should have appropriate expiration

Might want to add additional validation before token generation

Common Use Cases
SPA (Single Page Application) authentication flow

Mobile app authentication

Microservices architecture with JWT authentication

Systems where frontend and backend are separated

Potential Enhancements
Add token validation before redirect

Include additional security checks

Implement token refresh mechanism

Add logging for audit purposes

Handle cases where user isn't found in database
